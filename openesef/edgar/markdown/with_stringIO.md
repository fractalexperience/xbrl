# Q1: Can I initiate an `Instance` as defined in `instance/instance.py` with stringIO?
Based on the search results and the repository you mentioned, I'll help explain how to work with XBRL instances. However, I don't see direct information about StringIO usage in the search results.

Looking at the repository's code examples, the library primarily works with URLs and file locations [1](https://github.com/fractalexperience/xbrl/blob/master/examples/ixbrl_processing/sec_cik_1000177_20-f.py)[2](https://github.com/fractalexperience/xbrl/blob/master/examples/taxonomy_packages/eiopa_250_content.py).

The typical pattern shown in the examples is to use URLs or file paths:

```python
from xbrl.base import pool

# Create a data pool
data_pool = pool.Pool()

# Add instance using URL
location = 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000177/000114036121014948/brhc10022989_20f.htm'
xid = data_pool.add_instance_location(location=location, key=location, attach_taxonomy=True)
```

If you need to work with StringIO content, you would likely need to:
1. First save the content to a temporary file
2. Use that file path with the XBRL library
3. Clean up the temporary file after processing

Here's a suggested approach:

```python
import tempfile
from io import StringIO
from xbrl.base import pool

def process_xbrl_from_stringio(content: StringIO):
    # Create a temporary file
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.xml', delete=False) as tmp:
        # Write StringIO content to temp file
        tmp.write(content.getvalue())
        tmp_path = tmp.name

    try:
        # Create the data pool
        data_pool = pool.Pool()
        # Use the temporary file path
        xid = data_pool.add_instance_location(location=tmp_path, key=tmp_path, attach_taxonomy=True)
        return xid
    finally:
        # Clean up the temporary file
        import os
        os.unlink(tmp_path)
```

However, I recommend checking with the library maintainers or raising an issue on GitHub to confirm if there's a more direct way to work with StringIO, as this approach using temporary files is a workaround.
