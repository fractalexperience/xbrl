# XBRL Terminology

| **XBRL Term**             | **Business Term**                                      | **Description**                                              |

| Taxonomy                  | Rule Book and Specifications                           | Collection of definitions of reporting concepts, relationships between them and various resources |
| Instance Document         | Submission Document (Filing / XBRL Report)             | Container of the reporting facts. Its content is based on metadata defined in the taxonomy |
| Reporting Fact / Fact     | Data Point (A Cell in a QRT)                           | A fact holds the value for a cell but also includes all information to describe the cell - concepts (eg GWP), data type (eg monetary), descriptive dimensions (eg Motor business), entity (eg Insurance Company A), period (eg 31st December 2021), unit (eg USD), rounding information (eg 2 decimal places) |
| Reporting Concept         | Current Assets<br/>Goodwill<br/>Cashflow<br/>etc.      | Each reporting fact must have one and only one concept.<br/>Concept is the highest-level business descriptive part of a fact eg Best estimate. <br/>A concept is usually not enough to completely describe the business terms eg additional dimensions are needed to specify that the fact relates to: Claims provision (or premium provision) of Best estimate and health line of business etc. <br/>*Technical note: A concept is a template for a fact.*<br/>*Concepts can be organised into hierarchies.* |
| Context                   | Grouped information that supports similar data points  | Container of dimensional information related to a fact. Contexts can be shared between facts eg instead of repeating all datapoints relating to Motor business will refer to a context which specifies the line of business |
| Unit                      | Unit of a data point                                   | Describes how the fact is measured. For example: monetary value in **GBP**, monetary value in **USD**, non-monetary value (must be used in combination with Data type and Decimals attribute to ascertain the specific unit eg 2 d.p., 4 d.p. etc.) |
| Reporting Entity / Entity | Company ID (LEI / Local Registration Number)           | Provides identification of the reporting entity in the classification of a specific regulator eg can be LEI or in some cases the regulator requires a local registration number to be used to identify the insurer in the XBRL eg CBI in Ireland |
| Period                    | Reporting Period                                       | Either instant (year end date or quarter end date), or duration - start/end date. |
| Dimension                 | Line of business, Valuation method etc.                | Dimension is a property of a reporting fact eg line of business dimension or valuation method dimension. |
| Dimensional analysis      | Dimensional analysis                                   | The set of reporting facts can break down based on values of a specific dimension:<br/>Primary dimensions - entity, period, unit, Custom dimensions - specific concepts (**typed** and **explicit**) |
| Dimension Member          | Motor business<br/> IFRS</br> ISIN/US54374324<br/>etc. | The **concrete value** provided for a dimension. For example, for the line of business dimension, a dimension member would be “motor business” or “property business”. |
| Explicit dimensions       | Line of business, Country etc.                         | Where there is a closed list of possible values for a dimension, this is known an explicit dimension. For example, Country dimension (eg for country of authorization fact) is an explicit dimension with finite list of all country codes. |
| Typed dimensions          | Asset code, Identifier code etc.                       | Where a dimension can hold any value, this is known as a typed dimension. For example the asset code fact will hold an identifier for the asset which is not from a closed list. |
| Enumerations              | Issuer Country, Type of asset code etc.                | Where there is a closed list of possible values for a fact value, this is known as an enumeration. For example, Issuer Country fact can only have a value within a finite list of country codes |
| Dimension Domain          | e.g. Geographical areas                                | Set of all members of a domain, grouped by business concept eg geographical areas. The geographical areas domain lists all countries but also regions of countries (eg for reporting natural catastrophe exposures to Western Europe) |
