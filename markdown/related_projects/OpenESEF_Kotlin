## OpenESEF
`Open source implementation of ESEF-Parser/AnalysorAnalyser/Validator in Java/Kotlin`

## Cause
`Recently, I searched for a reliable open-source solution for the ESEF and I was totally suprised by the action of German software-Vendors who unanimously made their open-sourced xbrl-solution completely proprietary.`

## Roadmap
`Parser and presentation of 2021 financial statement of Top-5 DAX-Companies`
`ESEF-Analysoer and Validator`
`ESEF-Generator`
