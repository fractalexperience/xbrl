**Taxonomy discovery** is the process of loading XML Schema files and XBRL Linkbase files included in a specific taxonomy. The process starts with a list of XML Schema (*.xsd) files called **Entry Point**. Then it **recursively** follows all references inside XML Schemas and XBRL Linkbases, until all the content is loaded in memory.
