# Q1: show me how to load a xsd from URL: http://www.esma.europa.eu/taxonomy/2019-03-27/esef_all.xsd
Based on the repository content, I'll show you how to load an XSD from a URL using the XBRL library. Here's how you can do it:

```python project="XBRLExample" file="load_xsd.py" version=1
import sys
from xbrl.taxonomy import tpack

# URL of the XSD file
xsd_url = 'http://www.esma.europa.eu/taxonomy/2019-03-27/esef_all.xsd'

# Create a TaxonomyPackage instance
package = tpack.TaxonomyPackage(xsd_url)

# Compile the package to resolve locations
package.compile()

# View the package content
print(package)

# View list of resolved files
for url, fn in package.files.items():
    print(url, ' => ', fn)
```

This code follows the pattern shown in the example files from the repository [2](https://github.com/fractalexperience/xbrl/blob/master/examples/taxonomy_packages/ifrs_2020_filelist.py)[3](https://github.com/fractalexperience/xbrl/blob/master/examples/taxonomy_packages/eiopa_250_content.py). Here's what the code does:

1. First, we import the necessary module from the XBRL library
2. We create a TaxonomyPackage instance with the XSD URL
3. We compile the package to resolve all locations
4. We can then view the package content and list all resolved files

The code will download and process the ESMA ESEF taxonomy XSD file and its related components. The package.files dictionary will contain mappings between URLs and their corresponding local file locations.

Note that this library handles not just single XSD files but entire taxonomy packages, which is particularly useful for XBRL taxonomies that often consist of multiple interconnected files.

If you need to work with specific XBRL namespaces or access particular components, you can reference them using the constants defined in the library [1](https://github.com/fractalexperience/xbrl/blob/master/base/const.py), such as:

- NS_XBRLI for basic XBRL namespace
- NS_LINK for linkbase namespace
- NS_XS for XML Schema namespace
# Q2: show me how to load these files """/tmp/esef_all-cal.xml /tmp/esef_all-def.xml /tmp/esef_all-for.xml /tmp/esef_all-pre.xml /tmp/esef_all.xsd""" with xbrl.base.pool.Pool()
Based on the repository content, I'll show you how to load multiple XBRL files including XSD and linkbase files using the Pool class. Here's how you can do it:

```python project="XBRLExample" file="load_multiple_files.py" version=1
from xbrl.base import pool

# Create a new Pool instance
data_pool = pool.Pool()

# Define the file paths
files = [
    "/tmp/esef_all.xsd",        # Schema file
    "/tmp/esef_all-cal.xml",    # Calculation linkbase
    "/tmp/esef_all-def.xml",    # Definition linkbase
    "/tmp/esef_all-for.xml",    # Formula linkbase
    "/tmp/esef_all-pre.xml"     # Presentation linkbase
]

# Add the taxonomy using the XSD as entry point
taxonomy = data_pool.add_taxonomy(files[0])

# The linkbase files will be automatically discovered and loaded through the schema references
# But you can also add them explicitly if needed
for linkbase_file in files[1:]:
    data_pool.add_reference(linkbase_file, base="/tmp/")

# Print information about the loaded files
print("Data Pool Information:")
print("---------------------")
print(data_pool.info())

# You can access the loaded components through the data_pool properties:
print("\nLoaded Components:")
print("----------------")
print("Schemas:", list(data_pool.schemas.keys()))
print("Linkbases:", list(data_pool.linkbases.keys()))
```

This code demonstrates how to use the Pool class from the XBRL library [1](https://github.com/fractalexperience/xbrl/blob/master/base/pool.py). Here's what the code does:

1. Creates a new Pool instance which will manage all the XBRL components
2. Defines the list of files to load
3. Adds the taxonomy using the XSD file as the entry point
4. The linkbase files (cal, def, for, pre) will be automatically discovered and loaded through the schema references
5. Prints information about the loaded files using the Pool's info() method

The Pool class handles:
- Loading and managing taxonomy schemas
- Loading and managing linkbases
- Resolving references between files
- Caching loaded components

Key points to note:
- The Pool class will automatically handle the relationships between the files
- You can access the loaded components through data_pool.schemas and data_pool.linkbases
- The Pool class maintains a cache of loaded components for better performance
- The add_reference method can handle both local files and URLs

If you need to work with specific instances or want to attach taxonomies, you can use additional methods like:
```python
# Add an instance document
instance = data_pool.add_instance_location(location="path_to_instance.xml", attach_taxonomy=True)

# Access taxonomy components
taxonomy = data_pool.current_taxonomy
```

This approach follows the pattern shown in the example files and provides a robust way to work with XBRL taxonomies and their components [2](https://github.com/fractalexperience/xbrl/blob/master/examples/ixbrl_processing/sec_cik_1000177_20-f.py).
