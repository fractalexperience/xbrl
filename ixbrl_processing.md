[Inline XBRL](https://specifications.xbrl.org/spec-group-index-inline-xbrl.html) filings are well formed XHTML files, which include embedded XBRL facts. In many cases it is needed to extract the native XBRL content from such a filing for further processing. {XM} includes a module to directly load iXBRL files in memory and serialize them back as native XBRL.
